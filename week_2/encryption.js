// Hashing -> converting data into a fixed size O/P

// encryption -> process of converting plaintext data into an unreadable format, called ciphertext, using a specific algorithm and a key. The data can be decrypted back to its original form only with the appropriate key.

// Symmetric encryption -> The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
// Asymmetric encryption -> Different keys are used for encryption (private key) and decryption (public key).

// private key is used to sign a transaction and public key can be used to verify/decode the transaction, so that the miner can verify that the transaction is legit

// Common Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms:
// RSA - Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
// ECC - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECDSA) - ETH and BTC
// EdDSA - Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm  - SOL

// Common eleptic curves
// secp256k1 - BTC and ETH
// ed25519 - SOL
